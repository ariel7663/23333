# IEOR-4501 Session 002 - Final Project
# Group 23333

This project is designed as a Twitter Data Crawler, which takes a user's input of a specific twitter account, and returns several types of word map with the most frequently used words by this twitter user in his/her recent tweets. There are three types of wordmaps, a regular, a United States Flag, and a 'Love and Peace' map. Users can choose whichever he/she wants to print out.

We have included an example with President Donald Trump's twitter account (@realDonaldTrump) as a demo.
